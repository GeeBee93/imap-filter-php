# imap-filter-php
This small project contains a more easy way to handle IMAP Mailbox Filtering than offered through php directly. 

## What's the benefit?
After I moved my private mail from gmail to a smaller hosting company I encountered the problem that my hoster doesn't support server-side mail filtering. I didn't want to maintain my own server and as I only bought the smallest package I wasn't able to install imap-filter or something else on the server.
But I was able to run php script's and had the ability to create cronjobs. To make the experience much more better to filter IMAP Mails with PHP I created this small class.

## Usage
More on that later..
